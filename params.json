After that it pops up a menu for the user to choose where to upload the pictures to. An optional album name can be provided.\r\n\r\nLicense respected you can use it for what ever you like.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@thomas4U\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you're having trouble, like to contribute or need help, please create a new issue.\r\n",
